# Hypothesis-Testing-
Hypothesis testing on a blue_car sharing company

The main purpose of the study is to find out if there is a difference in the number BlueCars_taken per postal code, with the main postal codes of interest being the first two 75001 and 75002.

Null Hypothesis: Sample mean from postal code 75001 is equal to sample mean from postal code 75002
Alternative Hypothesis: Sample mean from postal code 75001 is not equal to sample mean from postal code 75002

The importance of this is to assist in identifying if the location (postal code) affects the number of Blue cars taken during the duration of the study. This will assist in improving the infrastructure of selected postal codes and increasing the number of Blue cars used in the selected postal code
